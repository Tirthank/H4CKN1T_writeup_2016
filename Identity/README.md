Problem:

Znex V, Alan's android, on receiving some unusual signals on their star, sent some patrol ships to capture alien beings.
On meeting Nyna, Mark I and Nyna's counsels, the android captured them and took them back to Alan's Galactic Palace.
Unable to recognize his sister, Alan asked the intruders about their identity.

Mark I replied this. (see attached sound file)


Solution:

We can see it is a wave file which sounds peculiar.
On a whim, I opened it using Audacity and tried viewing the spectogram. And there it was, the flag.
