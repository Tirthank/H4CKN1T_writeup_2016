Problem:

Trying for a long time, but Znex V could not decipher the message found on a piece of paper from Nyna's spaceship.
However, Alan got the answer as soon as he looked at the paper.
Can you tell what Alan found?

The following image file was included:

Solution:

The image looks like a plain white image.
Hmm, verry inconspicuous.
I opened it in paint, selected the colouring bucket, and filled in a random spot on the image.
The flag appeared as shown:
